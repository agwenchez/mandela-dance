                        physical – it is also socio-cultural, spiritual, and psychological. Everyone

                        Sexual and reproductive health and rights matters regarding Persons with Disabilities with an
                        aim of creating a more inclusive society for everyone has always been pointed solely at the
                        government based on the important role it has to play, but the truth holds that so do agencies
                        that
                        offer support to persons with disability, as well as each individual existing within a
                        community.
                        Much the same as every other individual, PwDs have the human stimulus for sexual expression.
                        This equates them to the same human rights, sentiments, sexual desires, requirements and visions
                        for family as anybody else.
                        It is important to realize how to define limits, and what is more, how to ensure against
                        disregard
                        of the right to the highest attainable standards of health for everyone including PwDs, which is
                        guaranteed constitutionally in Article 43, reinforced by the right to non-discrimination in
                        article
                        27. At the end of the day: all individuals – both male and female – with or without disability
                        have similar needs as far as access to SRHR information, services and rights go, with the goal
                        that they can celebrate fulfilling sexual lives and having a choice for family, when, and with
                        whom they need. It is quite often that SRHR needs of persons with disability are regularly
                        neglected. A widespread misguided opinion exists, that proposes that PwDs are asexual, and
                        thats far as affection, connections and having youngsters, it is believed to be ideal if people
                        with
                        inabilities try not to wander into these territories, for the wellbeing of their own and that of
                        society. With the inconvenience of such negative thoughts, and disclosing to them they are
                        unwanted and not deserving of wants, all things considered, the confidence of individuals with
                        handicaps is smothered. Thus, they probably won&#39;t look for access to SRHR services of their
                        choice.

                    <p style="font-family:open sans;background-color:beige;font-weight:500">People with disabilities
                        (PWDs) continue to face challenges in accessing reproductive health services despite the
                        provision in the constitution under article 43 that every person has a right to the highest
                        attainable level of health
                        including reproductive health. Because of their impairments, disabled people have more complex
                        and additional health
                        needs which exposes them to particular barriers when accessing health services. Many at times
                        they are stigmatized and
                        discriminated against by service providers who have not been trained on how to interact and
                        attend to the disabled, they
                        also assume disabled people to be asexual. Poor physical structures at the health centers such
                        as lack of ramps and high
                        examination and delivery beds have equally limited the disabled access and utilization of health
                        services. Additionally,
                        disabled women are discouraged from having children as they are considered incapable of
                        providing for the child or risk
                        passing the impairment to the child. These factors consequently create an enabling environment
                        for PWDs to suffer ill
                        health ranging from mental illnesses, gender based violence and even death.
                        Being impaired should not be translated to poor health, rather, the disabled should enjoy
                        quality health care and live
                        fully. It is then important that interventions and solutions offered should address the
                        complexity of their needs; this
                        accounts for review of reproductive health policy to include the disabled as a vulnerable group,
                        inclusion of
                        interpreters and other support persons in health centers, improved physical infrastructure,
                        autonomy of reproductive
                        rights to protect women from forced sterilization and measures to safeguard their privacy and
                        consent. There is also
                        need for collection of disaggregated data to help in monitoring and evaluating the disabled
                        needs and the health
                        interventions that are tailored for them.
                        Nonetheless, contemporary dancing has been used to create awareness, informing the disabled on
                        their reproductive and
                        social rights, advocating for partnerships between the community members, legislators and
                        service providers in tailoring
                        services according to the PWDs needs and providing necessary guidelines on interactions. This
                        intervention amongst
                        others will ensure the 10% that PWDs form have their well-being taken care of, as a result
                        participate in the
                        development agendas.</p>
